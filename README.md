# Access, MySQL, and MongoDB Database Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to work with multiple database systems (Access, MySQL, MongoDB) to create, populate, and query data using Python scripts. It is designed to handle various aspects of database interaction, including schema creation, data import, and SQL query execution.

## Features
- **Access Database**: 
  - Create tables in Microsoft Access.
  - Import data from CSV files.
  - Execute SQL queries and display results.

- **MySQL Database**: 
  - Create tables in MySQL.
  - Import data from CSV files.
  - Execute SQL queries and display results.

- **MongoDB Database**: 
  - Create collections in MongoDB.
  - Import data from JSON files.
  - Query and manipulate data using Python.


## How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Run the appropriate script based on the database you are working with:
   - For Access: `python createDB_Access.py`
   - For MySQL: `python createDB_MySql.py`
   - For MongoDB: `python createDB_MongoDB.py`

4. Ensure the CSV files are in the same directory as the scripts to import data correctly.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Microsoft Access Driver (for Access database)
- MySQL Server (for MySQL database)
- MongoDB Server (for MongoDB database)
